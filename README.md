Overview OF The Project :-
## Simple Calculator

### Overview

The Simple Calculator project is a basic arithmetic calculator implemented in Python. This project demonstrates fundamental programming concepts such as user input, basic arithmetic operations, control flow, and function usage. The calculator can perform addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.

### Features

- Addition of two numbers
- Subtraction of two numbers
- Multiplication of two numbers
- Division of two numbers
- Error handling for invalid inputs and division by zero

### Purpose

The purpose of this project is to provide a basic understanding of how a calculator works programmatically and to illustrate the implementation of core Python concepts. This project serves as an introductory exercise for those new to Python programming.

### Usage

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Navigate to the project directory.
3. Run the script using a Python interpreter.
4. Follow the on-screen instructions to perform arithmetic operations.

### Future Improvements

- Implementing additional operations (e.g., exponentiation, square root).
- Adding a graphical user interface (GUI) for better user interaction.
- Extending functionality to support more complex calculations.
